# Chapter 5. Reducing Costs with Duck Typing

Duck types are public interfaces that are not tied to any specific class.

Duck typed objects are chameleons that are defined more by their behavior than
their class.

## Understanding Duck Typing

An object can implement many different interfaces.

Users of an object need not, and should not, be concerned about its class.

It's not what an object *is* that matters, it's what it *does*.

If every object trusts all others to be what it expects at any given moment,
and any object can be any kind of thing, the design possibilities are infinite.

Using this flexibility wisely requires that you recognize these across-class
types and construct their public interfaces intelligently and dilligently.
