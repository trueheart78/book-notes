# Chapter 9. Designing Cost-Effective Tests

Writing changeable code is an art whose practice relies on three different skills.

First, you must understand object-oriented design. Poorly designed code is
naturally difficult to change. From a practical point of view, changeability is
the only design metric that matters; code that's easy to change *is* well-
designed.

Second, you must be skilled at refactoring code. And not just casually.

>  Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that
   it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves the internal
   structure. - Martin Fowler
