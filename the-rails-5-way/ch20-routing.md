# Chapter 20. Routing

The routing system is the system that examines the URL of an incoming request
and determines what action should be taken by the application. It also does a
lot more than that. The concepts are where the meat lies.

We'll cover the principal techniques for defining and manipulating routes, as
well as helping you to explore the facilities Rails offers in support of writing
apps that comply with the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
These should prove quite helpful.

The triggering of a controller action is the main event in the life cycle of a
connection to a Rails app. This is a very important portion of the determination
and is embodied in the routing system.

We'll spend more time in `config/routes.rb` to get up to speed.
