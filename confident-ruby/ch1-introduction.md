# Chapter 1. Introduction

*Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."* - Yukhiro "Matz" Matsumoto

**This is a book about Ruby, and about joy.**

Remember how you felt when you first saw the following code?

```ruby
3.times do
  puts "Hello, Ruby world!"
end
```

## Ruby Meets the Real World

Programming in Ruby was akin to programming in pseudocode; short, clear, intent-
revealing stanzas. No tedious boilerplate; no cluttered thickets of syntax.

As things like nested `if/then/else` logic and `&&` conditionals crept in, the
code began to lose its beauty. Objects stopped feeling like entities accepting
messages, and started to feel more like big bags of attributes.

The happiness continued to be drained.

## Confident Code

Applications usually go from idealistic beginnings to somewhat less satisfying
daily realities. A steady decline in how fun a project is the larger and older
it becomes. It probably even seems like the standard project trajectory.

You will see a collection of time-test techniques and patterns, all tied together
by **self-confidence**.

The principal task will be: **writing clear, uncluttered methods.**
