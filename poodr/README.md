# Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR)

By the wonderful [Sandi Metz](http://sandimetz.com).

**Design is writing code that is easy to change today and cheap to change in the future**

"Others are mucking it up" -
Good design can be good enough so that others making changes don't go right
to the wrong options. It takes intention, but is worth it vs the cost of not
doing it.
