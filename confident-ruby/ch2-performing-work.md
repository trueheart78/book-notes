# Chapter 2. Performing Work

Is all of a method performing work? If some code isn't getting any work done, it
shouldn't be in the method at all, right?

The structure of the "work" portion of your code is determined based on what tasks
your methods are responsible for doing, and only you can say what those are. We
want to isolate the "core" of the method's logic.

It all starts with the idea of **sending messages**.
