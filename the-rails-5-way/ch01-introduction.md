# Chapter 1. Introduction

While Rails 5 does not bring a huge leap forward in features like its predecessor
did, it does give us a level of fit and finish that surpasses any major technology
framework that most of us have ever worked with. Everything. Just. Works.

## About This Book

This is not a tutorial or basic intro to Ruby or Rails. The idea is for the
full-time Rails developer to give it a once over straight through at first, then
use it as a day-to-day reference. 

## Sample Code and Listings

Some of the source code for the examples can be found [on Github][github-url].

# Goals

The primary goal is to make this your working reference for Ruby on Rails. I
hope it gives you greater confidence in making design and implementation
decisions whole working on your day-to-day taks.
